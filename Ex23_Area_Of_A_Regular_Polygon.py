# Exercise 23:Area of a Regular Polygon
# A polygon is regular if its sides are all the same length and the angles between all of
# the adjacent sides are equal. The area of a regular polygon can be computed using
# the following formula, where s is the length of a side and n is the number of sides:
# area = n Ã— s square / 4 * tan (pi/n)
# Write a program that reads s and n from the user and then displays the area of a
# regular polygon constructed from these values.

from math import pi, tan

side = float(input("Enter the length of the side: "))
number_of_sides = int(input("Enter the number of sides: "))

area = (number_of_sides * pow(side,2)) / (4 * tan(pi / number_of_sides))

print("Area of the regular polygon:", area)
